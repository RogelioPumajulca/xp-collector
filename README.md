# XP-COLLECTOR


### Task:

XP-COLLECTOR is a simple data structure used to store and organise data. It is a structure because it arranges and links data in the simplest possible way to allow them to be accessed and managed efficiently. 

Two options are available for recording and linking data. 

Data input

Linking data

Complex structures can be created by simply linking individual data records. Similar to a mind map.

It should always be possible to enter data in the simplest way. The simplest way is ONE data set. In the following, we will call the individual data record a NODE.


Linking should always be done by connecting TWO individual data sets. The linking of two data records is referred to in the following as KANTS.
